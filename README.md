# TTRPG-Project 


## purpose
It should be a character sheet manager where players can share the sheet with the DM so they always can be on top on it.
So a free version of D&D beyond. 
but i want it to support multiple different systems. Where each system is a plugin that can be installed.

## Sprint design 
I will try and go about this project in phases in an iterative way using a cycle of phases 
The cycle will look a bit like the scrum life cycle.
My cycles being:
- Idea phase: where i create research and write down my main ideas
- Design Phase: Where the ideas will be designed with UML diagram and main architecture paradigms will be chosen for the function that shall be implemented
- Implementation: Where the design gets implemented, this phase can change the design or idea if pain points will be found during the implementation.
- Retrospect: Where the pain points found during the implementation will generate new ideas and possibly bugs and errors that need to be fixed in the next sprint cycle. 

Each sprint will be its own directory.

## Tools


### Sprint 1

In the first sprint i found out that my main focus should be on the users that are on chrome OS. This means this stand alone application needs to be put on hold. But the API's that needs to be developed for the website should also work when i need them for this application
this mean this project is but on hold but a new project with cloud flare pages and workers will start. 

After that project this can be picked up again.
