# TTRPG-Project 


## purpose
It should be a character sheet managaer where playes can share the sheet with the dm so they always can be ontop on it.
So a free version of DnD beyond. 
but i want it to support mutiple different systems. Where each system is a plugin that can be installed.

## Sprint design 
I will try and go about this project in phases in an iterative way using a cycle of phases 
The cycle will look a bit like the scrum lifecycle.
My cycles being:
- Idea phase: where i create research and write down my main ideas
- Design Phase: Where the ideas will be designed with uml diagram and main architecture paradigms will be chosen for the function that shall be implemented
- Implementation: Where the design gets implemented, this phase can change the design or idea if pain points will be found during the implementation.
- Retrospect: Where the pain points found during the implementation will generate new ideas and possibly bugs and errors that need to be fixed in the next sprint cycle. 

Each sprint will be its own directory.
